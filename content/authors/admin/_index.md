#     summary: |
#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am a Research Team Leader at eBrain Lab, New York University (NYU) Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, UAE. I received Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien), Vienna, Austria with an excellent distinction. Prior to that, I received B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and M.Sc. degree in Electronics Engineering from Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Indonesia with cumlaude distinction. In academia, I have worked as a teaching assistant at the Electrical Engineering ITB, a research assistant at the Microelectronics Center ITB, and a project research assistant at the Institute of Computer Engineering, TU Wien. Meanwhile, in industry, I also experienced working as an FPGA engineer at the PT. Fusi Global Teknologi, Indonesia, and at the TriLite Technologies GmbH, Austria. I received multiple HiPEAC Paper Awards and an ACM Showcase for my first-authored papers during Ph.D. study, and a best paper nomination in ICARCV 2024.
